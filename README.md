# Framework for graphical applications

This framework contains a set of features dedicated to graphical applications.

For now, it targets Windows OS and DirectX API.

It is still a work in progress and some features may still be prototype.

## Features

Here are some of the features:

### Object script

Object script is a language for describing data, like json or xml, but with
an additional layer of features dedicated to programmability (variables,
loops, functions, etc.).

When you need to describe data that kind of repeat, it may become useful.

### User Interface Framework

This GUI framework is designed to give the most freedom to a developper to
create a specific look & feel for their application. If you need your
application to follow a standard style, you shouldn't use this framework.
However, if you need specific widgets, a dedicated look & feel, fine control
over performances etc., then you should give it a try.
